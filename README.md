#Beweisen

beweisen in a tool used to check the biological validity of the kleuren software. 

To operate, clear previous data from and upload files to the various folders in the 'user_upload_folders' folder. Begin by clearing the 'gtf_files' folder, and loading it with the gtf files from the phylogenetic analysis. Then clear and load the bubble.out file from the kleuren program into the bubbles file. Also be sure to upload the reference genomes (remember to clear it first) used to generate the bubbles files into the 'ref_genomes_with_indexes' folder. Finally, return to the beweisen folder and run the beweisen.py program: 'python beweisen.py'
